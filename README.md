# **CitiBike Challenge**

## **Overview Analysis**

The purpose of the module and challenge was to create a visualization dashboard and story using Tableau to show our investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines is a solid proposal. To do this, we have gathered and analyzed data in regards to the Citibike program in New York City. We have focused on the month of August as it is the busiest time of the year for Citibikes in New York City.
